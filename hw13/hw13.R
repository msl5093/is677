# This question cannot be answered because the read.big.matrix command can only accept one data type
# for all the values it imports from an external file. We used the integer data type as most of the data
# points were integers/numeric in nature. Subsequently, the bigmemory package imported the Dest
# feature with all NAs as the original value was of data type string since they are the 
# corresponding IATA airport code.
